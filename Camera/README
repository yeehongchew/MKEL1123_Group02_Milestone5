This README file documents the issue faced with configuring the OV7670 camera which was intended to be used to take live images of fresh or stale fruits and vegetables. However, due to constraints of the board itself whereby it doesn't have DCMI functionality, I decided to explore the DMA capability of the F411 board in an attempt to read the inputs from the camera. The DMA is supposed to work in such a way that it reads in the data and interrupts the process when the data has been completely transferred. However, due to the huge size of image files, it's possible that it takes a longer time to transfer the data, plus due to time constraints for troubleshooting the code, the camera ultimately could not be implemented as part of this project and can instead be left for future works. This page includes the codes used for configuring the OV7670 camera.
